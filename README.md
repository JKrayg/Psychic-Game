This is a simple guess game made in javascript. The computer randmonly generates a letter from A-Z and the player has 9 chances to guess the correct letter. If the player can guess the letter correctly within 9 guesses , it counts as a win++. If the player cannot guess the correct letter within 9 guesses, it counts as a loss++. The player cannot guess the same letter more than once.

So, when I started writing this code out I knew I was going to need an array with the letters [A-Z] and I knew I was going to need to randomly generated a letter from that array. After I console logged the random letter and was getting the correct results I needed the players guess next. So I used the event.key
